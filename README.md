# DFI Community Scan Database

This app provides high level demographic and economic data for every town, city, and county in North Carolina. The tool was built to provide team members with easy-to-access data about new communities contracted with DFI.

The code here pulls demographic data through the two Census APIs (ACS data through tidycensus, and LODES data through LEHD), and other datasets compiled and updated annually through different North Carolina government sources.
